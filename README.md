## Objective
Youâ€™ve just drawn a Chance card saying you left your dorm key inside and now have to pay $20 for a replacement. To address this issue and ensure better security, Mike the Tiger has asked you to develop a new dorm security system. This system will improve access control and offer strong protection against hacking and unauthorized access, keeping your dorm secure and accessible for everyone.
*Your mission: design and implement this system to ensure all students can safely and efficiently access their dorms with ease!*

## Project Scope and Constraints
Using Python, your team will write a program that acts as a sign-in for each LSU resident. The flow of the project will go as follows:
1. The program asks the user to either register their dorm or select a dorm to access.
2. It will then ask the user to input their LSUID to ensure the ID is attached to the room.
3. After putting in their LSUID, it will prompt them to enter their password (three attempts allowed).
4. Lastly, ask the user to enter a second form of authentication (security question, pass key, numerical code etc.).

For each step, when the max amount of attempts is met, the user should not be able to move forward. The password, security question, and security answer for each dorm are up to the team.

The following below lists the minimum requirements needed for this project:
1. User input must be used
2. Use at least one while loop
3. Use at least one boolean
4. Have two if-else blocks that include three elif statements
5. Use at least one Integer
